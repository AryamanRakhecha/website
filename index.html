              <p class="card-text">The first section of the paper focuses on fundamental graph theory and includes basic
                definitions and proofs that relate to expander graphs and Cayley graphs. The second section of the paper
                focuses on Cayley graphs and delves into some basic group theory. The main section contains information
                about expander graph theory. This section first looks at what the properties and uses of expander graphs
                are, then moves onto the edge expansion ratio and examples of good and bad expanders. We then further
                explore the explicit construction of expanders and the applications of spectral graph theory in
                approximating the edge expansion ratio. The final section contains an expansion of a Cayley graph
                family.</p>

                load, internal (or physiological) load and sleep in measuring stress among healthcare staff working in
                the ICU.
                Firstly, we carried out a descriptive study so that all the data was presented by their average values
                and standard deviations. Then we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify the normality of the
                distributions. Then, we applied the Levene Test to verify equality of variances, and applied an ANOVA
                using the Games-Howell procedure as the post-hoc test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05,
                  with a confidence level of 95%. For this analysis, the SPSS software was used.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Modelling of Disease on Random Graphs</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The first section of the paper focuses on the models of random graphs and includes
                information on their thresholds and properties. We also illustrate some properties that are useful for
                later in the paper. The second section of the paper focuses on the modelling of disease and delves into
                some Erdos-Renyi graphs that can be used. During this section we also explore modelling a specific
                disease, COVID-19. We use information on the contact rate, transmissibility and infection period along
                with a set number of nodes to create a model. The final section discusses the measures we can take to
                prevent spreading of disease and again uses COVID-19 as a specific disease.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In this dissertation, the impact of technology on mathematics will be considered and
                discussed, from the early calculators to the future impacts of artificial intelligence. This topic is
                being studied due to the rapid increase in reliance on technology in mathematics. Accordingly, this
                research paper will seek to show how technology has impacted mathematics in different areas. The
                following paper aims to cover how technology has impacted mathematics in the past and how it will
                further develop mathematics in the future. There are many theories on the extent of the impact of
                technology on mathematics, and how much the reliance on technology will increase in the future. Through
                the points mentioned above, an argument will be made concerning the impacts of technology on
                mathematics.</p>
